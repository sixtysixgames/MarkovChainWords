                <p>
                    Put extremely simply, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain" target="_blank">Markov Chain</a> is a series of events where one event depends on the previous event only.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use this tool to create new words from an existing set of words.
                    <br />
                    Enter your corpus of words into the box below.  Somewhere between 50 and 500 words is recommended, but not necessary.  
                    However, too few words and there won't be much variation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We iterate through all the words and break them into vowel groups and consonant groups.<br />
                    For each word we record which group is a start and which group is an end.<br />
                    We also record which group can follow another group.<br />
                    We then output new words by randomly selecting a start group, then slowly build up the word by selecting a valid following group until we find an end group.
